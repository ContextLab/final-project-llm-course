**Parent:** [llm-course](https://github.com/ContextLab/llm-course) (see main AGENTS.md)

## Overview

Final project template repository for PSYC 51.17. Students conduct independent research applying concepts from the course.

## Structure

```
final-project-llm-course/
├── FinalProject_Template.ipynb  # Template notebook (has Colab badge)
├── README.md                    # Project guidelines
└── AGENTS.md                    # This file

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `FinalProject_Template.ipynb` | Student-facing notebook with Colab badge |

## Conventions

- Notebook opens in Colab via badge at top
- Students fork via GitHub Classroom, not direct clone
- Open-ended project with student-defined scope

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't commit example solutions (student creativity expected)
- Don't over-constrain the template structure

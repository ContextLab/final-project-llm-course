## Overview

The final project is your opportunity to synthesize everything you've learned throughout this course into an ambitious, cutting-edge project that showcases your mastery of large language models and conversational AI. This is a **capstone experience** where you'll tackle a challenging problem that would be nearly impossible in a traditional course—but is achievable with the help of modern GenAI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot.

Unlike the structured problem sets, this project is **open-ended and research-oriented**. You have the creative freedom to explore novel applications, replicate and extend published research, build innovative systems, or conduct rigorous evaluations of LLM capabilities. The goal is to produce work that is intellectually sophisticated, technically ambitious, and potentially publishable or deployable in the real world.

This is your chance to:
- Explore a topic you're genuinely passionate about
- Push the boundaries of what you thought possible
- Create something meaningful that extends beyond the classroom
- Build a portfolio piece that demonstrates your AI/ML capabilities
- Potentially contribute to ongoing research in the field

You will work in **teams of 2-3 students** over **4 weeks (Weeks 7-10)**, leveraging your combined skills and interests to tackle problems that would be challenging for any individual. The collaborative nature of this project mirrors real-world research and industry practices.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

1. **Synthesize course concepts**: Integrate knowledge from all assignments—from rule-based systems (ELIZA) to modern transformers (GPT), from embeddings to fine-tuning.
2. **Design and execute research**: Formulate research questions, design methodologies, implement solutions, and critically evaluate results.
3. **Master LLM tools and frameworks**: Work extensively with Hugging Face, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, PyTorch, and other modern ML frameworks.
4. **Leverage GenAI for ambitious projects**: Use AI coding assistants to implement complex systems that would traditionally take months.
5. **Communicate technical work**: Present findings clearly through code, visualizations, presentations, and written reports.
6. **Think critically about AI**: Evaluate limitations, biases, ethical implications, and societal impacts of your work.
7. **Collaborate effectively**: Work in a team to divide tasks, integrate components, and produce cohesive results.

## Project Scope

Your project should represent approximately **4 weeks of focused work for a team of 2-3 students (Weeks 7-10)**. This translates to roughly 15-20 hours per person per week, though the actual time investment may vary based on your background and the project's complexity.

### Scale and Ambition

With GenAI assistance, you can tackle projects that would have been impossible just a few years ago. However, be realistic about scope:

**Appropriate scale:**
- Fine-tuning a model on a custom dataset for a specific task
- Building a multi-component system (e.g., RAG with custom embeddings and retrieval)
- Replicating a recent paper and extending it with new experiments
- Creating a novel evaluation framework for LLM capabilities
- Developing an agent-based system with multiple tools and reasoning components

**Too small:**
- Simple prompt engineering exercises
- Basic API wrapper applications
- Straightforward classification tasks using existing models
- Tutorials or literature reviews without implementation

**Too ambitious (probably):**
- Training a foundation model from scratch
- Building a production-scale application with full frontend/backend
- Projects requiring weeks of data collection
- Multiple independent research questions that should be separate projects

### Finding the Right Balance

A good rule of thumb: your project should involve at least 3-4 substantial technical components (e.g., custom data processing + model fine-tuning + evaluation framework + analysis), where each component requires thoughtful design and implementation.

## Project Types

Your project should fall into one or more of the following categories:

### 1. Novel Applications of LLMs
Design and implement a new application that leverages LLMs in creative ways. Focus on solving a real problem or creating something genuinely useful.

**Examples:**
- Domain-specific assistants (medical diagnosis helper, legal research tool, educational tutor)
- Creative tools (story co-writer, game master, music lyric generator)
- Accessibility applications (sign language translation, simplified text generation)
- Professional tools (code documentation generator, literature review assistant)

### 2. Research Replication and Extension
Reproduce results from a recent research paper, then extend the work with new experiments, datasets, or analyses.

**Examples:**
- Replicate a fine-tuning approach from a paper, then test on new domains
- Reproduce an evaluation study, then extend with additional models or metrics
- Implement a published architecture, then ablate components to understand contributions

### 3. New Model Architectures or Training Approaches
Explore modifications to existing architectures or novel training procedures. This is advanced but achievable with GenAI help.

**Examples:**
- Modified attention mechanisms for specific tasks
- Novel fine-tuning approaches (e.g., parameter-efficient methods)
- Hybrid architectures combining different model types
- Custom loss functions or training objectives

### 4. Analysis and Evaluation of LLMs
Conduct rigorous empirical studies of LLM capabilities, limitations, or behaviors.

**Examples:**
- Systematic evaluation of reasoning abilities across multiple models
- Bias analysis in specific domains or demographic groups
- Consistency and reliability testing under various conditions
- Comparative studies of different prompting strategies or model families

### 5. Multimodal and Agent-Based Systems
Build systems that integrate multiple modalities (text, image, audio) or implement autonomous agents with reasoning and tool use.

**Examples:**
- Vision-language systems for image description or visual question answering
- Agents that can plan, use tools, and complete complex tasks
- Multi-agent systems with specialized roles and communication
- Cross-modal retrieval or generation systems

### 6. Safety, Alignment, and Ethics
Investigate critical issues around AI safety, bias, fairness, or societal impact.

**Examples:**
- Jailbreaking detection and mitigation strategies
- Bias measurement and debiasing techniques
- Factuality and hallucination analysis
- Privacy and security considerations in LLM applications

## Tips for Success

### Start Early
Don't underestimate the time required. Even with GenAI assistance, projects take longer than expected. Starting early gives you time to iterate, handle unexpected challenges, and produce polished results.

### Embrace Failure and Iteration
Not everything will work on the first try. That's normal in research. Build in time to try multiple approaches, debug issues, and refine your methods based on what you learn.

### Use GenAI Aggressively
This is where you can be truly ambitious. Use tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot to:
- Implement complex architectures you haven't built before
- Write data processing pipelines quickly
- Debug tricky errors
- Generate boilerplate code
- Understand unfamiliar libraries or papers
- Brainstorm ideas and approaches

**Remember**: You're responsible for understanding and validating what AI generates. Always test, verify, and critically evaluate AI-generated code.

### Scope Appropriately
It's better to do one thing really well than three things poorly. If you find your project is too ambitious, narrow the focus rather than delivering incomplete work.

### Communicate Clearly
Technical sophistication is important, but so is clear communication. Make sure your code, writeup, and presentation are understandable to intelligent non-experts.

### Document Everything
Keep track of experiments, decisions, and results as you go. This makes writing the final report much easier and helps you understand what worked and why.

### Leverage Your Team's Strengths
Different team members may excel at different aspects (coding, experimentation, writing, visualization). Divide labor strategically but ensure everyone understands the full project.

### Make It Yours
Choose a project you're genuinely excited about. Passion and curiosity will sustain you through challenges and lead to better results.
